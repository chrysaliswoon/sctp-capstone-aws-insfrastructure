## Setting Up the Development Environment

To set up the development environment for managing AWS infrastructure using Terraform, follow these steps. Environment variables such as AWS credentials will be handled via GitHub Actions secrets, so no need to configure them manually.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:chrysaliswoon/sctp-capstone-aws-insfrastructure.git
   cd sctp-capstone-aws-insfrastructure
   ```

2. **Install Terraform:**
You need to install Terraform to manage your AWS infrastructure. You can download it from Terraform's official website or use a package manager:

    - **For macOS:**

   ```bash
    brew install terraform
   ```

   - **For Windows**: Download the binary from the website and add it to your system's PATH.

    Check the installation:

    ```bash
    terraform --version
    ```


3. Set Up AWS CLI

To interact with AWS services, you'll need to install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). You can download it from AWS CLI official documentation.

    - **For macOS:**

   ```bash
    brew install awscli
   ```

   - **For Windows**: Download the installer and follow the installation guide on AWS's website.

This repository uses GitHub Actions for automating deployments to AWS. The AWS credentials and environment variables are securely stored in GitHub Secrets and are used during the CI/CD pipeline.

To trigger a deployment, simply push your changes to the main branch, and the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically apply the Terraform changes. You can monitor the pipeline in the Actions tab of the GitHub repository.
